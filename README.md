# Openshift workshop 

This workshop aims to get people with limited or no experience of Openshift a good foundation to start. While it does deal with some of the theory, it focuses on hands on experience of common tasks that a system administrator likely will have to do. 

This workshop has been written specifically for people with some previous experience of the Windows operating system but works for anyone who is new to Linux.

This workshop uses ```Red Hat Openshift```, but acquired knowledge is often applicable for other kubernetes distributions.

# Contributions
Please note that this workshop is also an open source project. That means that anyone who wants are welcome to submit suggestions for improvements. It does not matter if you are attending the workshop or setting it up for others, please contribute improvements if you can :)

# If you are attending a workshop

Welcome, below is everything you need to know in order to get started.

## Content overview

:exclamation: Further down you will get intructions on how to get started.

```Labs:```
- **(lab1) Introduction to containers and kubernetes**
    - Learn the basics of a typical container architecture. This will cover container images, registries, hosts, and orchestration.
    - https://developers.redhat.com/courses/subsystems/intro
- **(lab2) Foundations of Openshift**
    - Start with the foundations to get hands-on experience creating and deploying applications in Red Hat OpenShift in Red Hat's interactive learning environments. In this learning path, you will learn:
    - The basic concepts behind OpenShift
    - How to create and deploy applications directly into an OpenShift cluster from source as well as Linux containers
    - How to work with Live Coding to compile and deploy the changes immediately and automatically into OpenShift
    - How to create data-driven applications using a variety of OpenShift data technologies
    - https://developers.redhat.com/learn/openshift/foundations-openshift
- **(lab3) Develop with GitOps**
    - Use GitOps and OpenShift Pipelines to implement Kubernetes-native CI/CD, automate and manage app deployment.
    -  https://developers.redhat.com/learn/openshift/develop-gitops
- **(lab4) Developing OpenShift applications with Java and Quarkus**
    - Quarkus is a powerful technology that streamlines Java programming under OpenShift. In this learning path, you will learn: 
    - How to create, test, and deploy Java code to OpenShift in a seamless development workflow.
    - How to take advantage of Live Coding to test and deploy your applications in real time as you code.
    - How to write fully functional, robust applications running in OpenShift without having to waste time writing a lot of redundant code.
    - How to use Quarkus to write data-driven applications using a variety of data sources with just a few lines of code.
