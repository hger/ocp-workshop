# Openshift workshop 

This workshop aims to get people with limited or no experience of Openshift a good foundation to start. While it does deal with some of the theory, it focuses on hands on experience of common tasks that a system administrator likely will have to do. 

This workshop uses ```Red Hat Openshift```, but acquired knowledge is often applicable for other kubernetes distributions.


# If you are attending a workshop

Welcome, below is everything you need to know in order to get started.

```Labs:```
- **Introduction to containers and kubernetes (lab0)**
    - Learn the basics of a typical container architecture. This will cover:
      - container images
      - container registries
      - container hosts
      - container orchestration.

- **Foundations of Openshift (lab1)**
    - Start with the foundations to get hands-on experience creating and deploying applications in Red Hat OpenShift in Red Hat's interactive learning environments. In this learning path, you will learn:
      - The basic concepts behind OpenShift
      - How to create and deploy applications directly into an OpenShift cluster from source as well as Linux containers
      - How to work with Live Coding to compile and deploy the changes immediately and automatically into OpenShift
      - How to create data-driven applications using a variety of OpenShift data technologies
    - https://developers.redhat.com/learn/openshift/foundations-openshift
- **Develop with GitOps (lab2)**
    - Learn how to GitOps with OpenShift Pipelines, you will implement:
      - Kubernetes-native CI/CD
      - automate and manage app deployment.

- **Developing OpenShift applications with Java and Quarkus (lab3)**
    - Quarkus is a powerful technology that streamlines Java programming under OpenShift. In this learning path, you will learn: 
      - How to create, test, and deploy Java code to OpenShift in a seamless development workflow.
      - How to take advantage of Live Coding to test and deploy your applications in real time as you code.
      - How to write fully functional, robust applications running in OpenShift without having to waste time writing a lot of redundant code.
      - How to use Quarkus to write data-driven applications using a variety of data sources with just a few lines of code.
